            <h2>Our Certificates & online program.</h2>
            <p>Expand your knowledge and unlock your potential with Stanford Online. You can study anywhere while you explore a lifetime of opportunities including free online courses, professional education, and credit-bearing programs & degrees. Find the right fit for you and your organization.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Obtain that promotion, make a career move, or expand your knowledge and skills with Stanford professional education, designed to help you reach your goals while maintaining your career.</p>
            <br>
            <p>If you choose the interest-free payment option for programs for which it is available, your first payment will be due immediately upon enrollment. Subsequent payments will be automatically billed to your credit card based on the schedule that appears on your program's web page. If you are enrolling in an online program that includes multiple courses, you will gain full access to all courses in the program immediately upon your first payment.</p>
            <br>
            <p>If you would like to make either your second or third payment prior to their due dates, please login to your mystanfordconnection and click “Invoices” and enter in your credit card.

                If, for any reason, we do not receive either of the final two payments within 5 business days of their due dates, your access to any and all of the courses in the program will be canceled, and any badges and/or certificates may be revoked.</p>
            <br>
            <p> You have the option to drop the course and receive a full refund until the day prior to the course start date. If you decide to drop the course during the first three weeks of the cohort, by Friday at 5:00 pm PST, you will be eligible for a 100% tuition reimbursement minus a drop fee. However, tuition refunds are not granted after the third week of the course. In some cases, transfers to future sections of the course may be allowed, subject to a change fee, once the course has commenced. It is important to note that SCPD reserves the right to decline refund requests. For instructor-paced programs like Artificial Intelligence and Product Management Accelerated, the rules, and deadlines for dropping or transferring may differ. Please refer to the course syllabus or contact the course organizers for specific details.</p>
